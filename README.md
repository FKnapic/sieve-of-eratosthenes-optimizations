# Sieve of Eratosthenes – Algorithm Analysis and Optimizations

This repository contains the implementation and analysis of the Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm,
developed as part of my bachelor thesis.

## Thesis Information
- **Title:** Software Support for the Sieve of Eratosthenes
- **Mentor:** prof. dr. sc. Mario Krnić


## Problem Description
The Sieve of Eratosthenes is one of the oldest algorithms in number theory and is used to find
all prime numbers less than a given natural number.  
The goal of this work is to implement the basic algorithm, analyze its time and space complexity,
and explore several optimizations.

## Implemented Algorithms
- Basic Sieve of Eratosthenes
- Sieve optimized up to √n
- Sieve using only odd numbers
- Segmented (block-based) sieve
- Linear-time sieve

## Analysis
Each algorithm variant includes an analysis of:
- Time complexity
- Space complexity
- Practical performance characteristics

## Technologies
- Programming language: Java
